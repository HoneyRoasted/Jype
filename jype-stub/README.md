# Jype Stub
The Stub module defines a YAML DSL for building type objects and performing tests on the main module's solvers. It
is primarily used in running the main module's test suite, but could also be used to provide ways to define
types and constraints via YAML. See examples in the [main module's tests](../jype-main/src/test/resources/stub_tests).
